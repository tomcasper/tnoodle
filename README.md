# TNoodle

TNoodle is a software suite that contains the official WCA scramble program. It consists of the core scrambling code (primarily written in Java) as well as a UI and server to generate a fully autonomous JAR file

## WCA Scramble Program

The official scramble program for the [World Cube Association](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/) has been part of the TNoodle project since January 1, 2013. It will contain the sole official scramble program for the foreseeable future.

All WCA official competitions must always use the current version of the official scramble program. This is available from <https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/scrambles/>

Note that only the scramble program part of TNoodle is "official". Other TNoodle projects may be convenient for certain uses (including at official competitions), but do not have any official status.

### "Scramble Program" vs. "Scrambler"

Officially, `TNoodle-WCA` is a [scramble program](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#4f), while a [scrambler](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#A2b) is a human. It is fine to refer to TNoodle as a "scrambler" colloquially, but please try to use the official convention wherever possible.

## Project Details

TNoodle is organised as a multi-project [Gradle](https://gradle.com) build. The build files are written in the type-safe `Kotlin` dialect.

Every sub-project has its individual artifact configuration and `build.gradle` file. Furthermore, there is a central `buildSrc` folder,
which is automatically sourced by Gradle. It contains common code and shared configuration setups.

### Overview

Gradle is served through the use of a `Gradle wrapper` available as `gradlew` (UNIX systems) or `gradlew.bat` (DOS systems)
It is recommended to set up an alias to simplify task generation, along the lines of `alias gw='./gradlew --parallel'`.

Get an overview of the core project tasks by executing

    ./gradlew tasks

### Setup

Gradle automagically handles all dependencies for you. You just need an Internet connection upon your first build run!

### WCA Scramble Program

When you're ready to develop, run the following and then visit <http://localhost:2014/scramble/>

    ./gradlew :webscrambles:runShadow

To build a distributable/executable `.jar` file, run:

    ./gradlew :webscrambles:shadowJar

You can run the `.jar` from the commandline using: (replace the `$VERSION` tag accordingly)

    java -jar TNoodle-WCA-$VERSION.jar

_Important note: You must never use a custom build for any official competitions._ [Contact the WCA Board and the WRC](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/contact) if you have any questions about this.

### Notes

-   Each project is a fully fledged Gradle project (they each have a `build.gradle.kts` file). Your IDE should be able to import Gradle build structures nowadays. If not, this is a good indicator that your IDE is outdated and should be replaced.
